# Technical Decision Log

This document records important architectural and technical decisions made during AuthMe development.

---

## 2026-05-04: Security Issues Resolution

### Decision: User Enumeration Prevention

**Context**: Multiple endpoints were exposing user existence information through error messages.

**Decision**: Standardize error messages to use generic responses regardless of whether the user exists.

**Consequences**:
- `sendVerificationEmail` returns same message for invalid email
- `validatePostLogoutRedirectUri` returns generic error
- All 404 responses use generic messages

**Related Issues**: #582, #583

---

## 2026-05-04: Token Introspection for Disabled Users

### Decision: Return `active: false` for disabled users without username

**Context**: Token introspection was returning `active: false` but still including username field, violating RFC 7662.

**Decision**: Return complete `{ active: false }` response immediately when user is disabled or deleted.

**Related Issues**: #614, #591

---

## 2026-05-04: Role Assignment User Verification

### Decision: Add user existence check to `assignClientRoles`

**Context**: `removeUserClientRoles` had user existence check but `assignClientRoles` did not.

**Decision**: Add consistent user existence verification to all role operations.

**Related Issues**: #617

---

## 2026-05-04: WebAuthn Realm Validation

### Decision: Validate user belongs to realm before generating authentication options

**Context**: `generateAuthenticationOptions` was accepting userId without verifying realm ownership.

**Decision**: Add user existence check with realm boundary validation.

**Related Issues**: #618

---

## 2026-05-04: MFA Step-Up for Admin Operations

### Decision: Require MFA step-up for critical admin operations

**Context**: Admin disabling user MFA should require additional verification.

**Decision**:
- API key auth blocked for MFA disable operations
- JWT session must have MFA ACR level verified
- Step-up verification required

**Related Issues**: #578, #577

---

## 2026-05-04: Admin Role Verification

### Decision: Add `RequireAdminRoles` decorator for critical realm operations

**Context**: Critical operations like realm deletion should require super-admin role.

**Decision**: Create `AdminRolesGuard` and `RequireAdminRoles` decorator to enforce role-based access for admin operations.

**Related Issues**: #577

---

## 2026-05-04: Session Revocation Race Condition

### Decision: Use `updateMany` instead of individual deletes in `revokeAllUserSessions`

**Context**: Previous implementation had race condition between finding sessions and deleting them.

**Decision**: Use atomic `updateMany` and `deleteMany` operations with proper where clauses.

**Related Issues**: #574

---

## 2026-05-04: Admin API Key Rate Limiting

### Decision: Add rate limiting for Admin API key authentication

**Context**: Static API key had no rate limiting protection.

**Decision**: Implement 15 requests/minute, 100 requests/hour limit for API key auth.

**Related Issues**: #575

---

## 2026-05-04: Impersonation Security

### Decision: Normalize API key adminUserId format with prefix

**Context**: API key impersonation sessions stored inconsistent actor identity.

**Decision**: Prefix API key actors with `api-key:` for consistent audit trail.

**Related Issues**: #573

---

## 2026-04-13: In-Memory Rate Limiting

### Decision: Document in-memory fallback behavior for multi-instance deployments

**Context**: When Redis unavailable, rate limiting uses per-instance memory.

**Decision**: This is documented behavior - distributed deployments require Redis for consistent rate limiting.

**Related Issues**: #581

---

## 2026-04-13: Backchannel Logout Error Handling

### Decision: Catch errors from backchannel logout to prevent unhandled rejections

**Context**: Fire-and-forget backchannel logout without error handling could cause issues.

**Decision**: Add `.catch()` handler for backchannel logout promises.

**Related Issues**: #594

---

## 2026-04-13: Token Revocation Input Validation

### Decision: Validate token is non-empty before processing revocation

**Context**: Empty token parameter could cause issues.

**Decision**: Return 400 BadRequest if token is empty or whitespace only.

**Related Issues**: #592

---

## 2026-04-13: Basic Auth URI Error Handling

### Decision: Wrap `decodeURIComponent` in try-catch

**Context**: Malformed URI encoding could throw URIError.

**Decision**: Wrap Basic auth decoding in try-catch to handle malformed input gracefully.

**Related Issues**: #593

---

## Architecture Decisions

### 2026-01-15: Prisma ORM for Database Access

**Decision**: Use Prisma ORM instead of raw SQL or query builder.

**Rationale**:
- Type-safe queries
- Migration management
- Easy database switching (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite)

---

### 2025-11-20: Argon2id for Password Hashing

**Decision**: Use Argon2id for password hashing (RFC 9106).

**Rationale**:
- Memory-hard function resistant to GPU attacks
- Better than bcrypt for modern security requirements

---

### 2025-10-05: JWT RS256 Signing

**Decision**: Use RS256 (RSA + SHA-256) for JWT signing.

**Rationale**:
- Asymmetric - private key signs, public key verifies
- Better for multi-service architectures than HS256

---

### 2025-08-12: Redis for Caching and Sessions

**Decision**: Use Redis as optional cache layer.

**Rationale**:
- Improves performance for frequent lookups
- Enables horizontal scaling with session sharing
- Graceful fallback to in-memory when unavailable
